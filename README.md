📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases to uncover patterns in spending, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior. The objective is to deliver data-driven insights that help improve sales performance, customer engagement, and long-term loyalty.

The project follows a complete analytics lifecycle — from data preparation and SQL analysis to interactive dashboards and executive-level reporting.
